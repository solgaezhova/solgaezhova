### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Olya.
A former real estate lawyer, now a passionate and results-driven Frontend Developer. 

I have around two years of web development experience with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), React, and Vue.js. 
I also have some backend working experience with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and realtional databases. 
But my passion is building beautiful user-centric responsive interfaces.
My motto is "No day without learning!" 

Some facts about me:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio transitioning from a software engineer into a frontend developer.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning UI/UX to be a better developer, and I am a member of the Interaction Design Foundation.

âš¡ Fun facts abot me: 
- I have lived, studied and worked in 4 countries (Russia, Germany, Israel, USA). You can guess how many languages I speak :) 
- I worked as a teacher, translator, interpretor, lawyer and software engineer.
- I have two Master's degrees in Law and Linguistics, and a lot of professional certificates on Web Development. A constant learner :)
- Apart from coding and learning, I love traveling, hiking, biking, and all extreme adventures!
